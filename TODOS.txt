Pixel Sorter: 
- Complete the Windows form for the images

- Create Graphics Bitmap to draw pixel map of from array of randomly generated values 

- Save Bitmap as an image

- Sort Bitmap using sorting algorithm. Need to do this using a HUE value for reference

- Save this SrtedBitmap as an image as well. 

- Create Triggered events for buttons in Window to work with the control of the program. 

- Allow for update of images in WPF Window for onc the image has been generated and then for when the image has been sorted. 

- Unit testing for prorgram

- Mock testing for dependencies

Transposer: 
- Technically does not meet requirements as first transposed image is manually copied.
   - This can be easily fixed just changing how files are read in and where they are written.

- Unit testing using Mocks 

- Mock testing for dependancies that are used. 




- If Pixel class is needed one could also implement Factory design pattern for pixel creation. But I think this is overcomplicated.
